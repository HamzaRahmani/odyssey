# Odyssey

Odyssey is an open source app that helps developers follow the 20-20-20 rule to promote better eye care.

The 20-20-20 rule is a tactic widely used to avoid eye strain symptoms. The concept is simple: Every 20 minutes, look up from your screen and focus on an item approximately 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.
